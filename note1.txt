#Servelet filters: 
-- A Servlet filter is a component in Java Servlet technology that intercepts incoming requests and outgoing responses to perform some pre-processing or post-processing tasks. It provides a way to modify or enhance the request/response handling process before the request reaches the servlet or after the servlet generates the response.

--Spring security framework is based on these servelet filters
